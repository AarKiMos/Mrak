Secure cloud storage system

This project was part of the minor project for the Btech course of Jaypee Institute of Information Technology Noida. A group of 4 members completed this project.

About the project:-
Cloud storage is a popular choice for storing and sharing backup data. While it is extremely convenient for users, it has some drawbacks on security grounds. Users are at the mercy of their cloud service providers for the privacy of their data.
Privacy is something which could very well prove to be a deal breaker for a user when it comes to storing any type of data. There have been numerous cases of private data leak in small and large organisations which cost users their fundamental right, the right to privacy. Therefore, it becomes extremely important for any type of organization to build a system which could securely store the data of users. The whole motivation behind this project is to demonstrate how data can be securely stored on cloud using cryptography.
This cloud storage system stores the file in an encrypted form which is unbreakable for an attacker. The files only get decrypted if the user himself/herself decides to download them.
